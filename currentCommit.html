                <p>I am currently pursuing a B.Tech. in Computer and Communication Engineering at Manipal University Jaipur, from the batch of 2022–2026. It has been an excellent experience so far—both academically and personally.

                    The program offers a strong mix of computer science and communication technologies, and I've had the opportunity to explore areas like programming (C, Java, Python), web development, and database design, along with emerging fields like AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and Blockchain.
                    
                    MUJ has provided a supportive environment for growth, collaboration, and hands-on learning, helping me build a solid foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical skills. I'm excited to continue exploring my interests and preparing for a career in tech.</p>

            I am currently investing significant time in advancing my Node.js expertise as part of my backend development journey. To broaden my full-stack skills, I’m pursuing a MERN stack certification through a comprehensive <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/programs/mu-jaipur-credit-program-4hmra/specializations/packt-mern-stack-front-to-back-full-stack-react-redux-and-node-js?"">Packt Coursera course</a>. Alongside this, I am enhancing my frontend capabilities by diving deeper into React. Additionally, I’m exploring cloud computing fundamentals with the support and guidance of my dad, which is helping me gain a broader understanding of modern application deployment and infrastructure.</p>
